=== Enum Construction Tests ===
Testing the 'enum' keyword with variant construction

1. Result enum with Success variant:
   Created Result::Success(200)

2. Result enum with Error variant:
   Created Result::Error("File not found")

3. Number enum with Int variant:
   Created Number::Int(42)

4. Number enum with Long variant:
   Created Number::Long(9876543210)

=== All enum construction tests passed! ===

Note: 'enum' keyword creates tagged unions with discriminants.
      Each variant is stored with a tag for safe type checking.
      Use with 'match' statements for exhaustive pattern matching.

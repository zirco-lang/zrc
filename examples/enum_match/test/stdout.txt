=== Union Variant Construction Tests ===
Demonstrating 'enum types' per SPEC.md section 3.7

1. Constructing Result::Success variant:
Got success code: 200

2. Constructing Result::Error variant:
Got error message: File not found

3. Constructing Shape::Circle variant:
Got circle with radius: 5

4. Constructing Shape::Rectangle variant:
Got rectangle with area: 100

=== All union variant construction tests passed! ===

Note: This demonstrates the 'enum types' concept from the spec:
      unions where exactly one variant is initialized and the
      active variant is tracked by the programmer.

Note: The `enum` keyword creates fully tagged unions with
      automatic discriminants and requires match statements.

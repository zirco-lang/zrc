//! # Common patterns in tests
//! The old form of unit tests for `zrc_codegen` involved directly invoking the
//! functions we are testing, which meant we needed to prepare all of the needed
//! scope for inkwell and this led to very complicated and long tests (with most
//! averaging at least 100 lines). This deterred me from testing as often as I
//! wanted, and many bugs were not found because of this.
//!
//! Instead, we now make our unit tests entire *programs* that we compile
//! through the same process that the frontend uses, and we snapshot test the
//! result. However, this almost turns out to be an integration test, and not a
//! unit test! The reason I still consider these to be unit tests is because the
//! code is short and meant to invoke a very specific block of code in whatever
//! function we are testing, and not a full program. We will have full
//! integration tests in the future.
//!
//! Read any test for an example of how they flow. We recommend `cargo-insta` be
//! installed so you can `cargo insta review` any changed snapshots.
